# Java Design Patterns
Accumulated while working trough 'Head First Design Patterns'

### Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one objects changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

### Decorator Pattern
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
